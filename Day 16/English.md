## Sounding alert about vanishing US coastlines

09 AUGUST 2019|ENVIRONMENT

Equipped with little more than a camera and a bird's eye view, J Henry Fair's new book captures the ongoing environmental threat to America's coastal region.

He hopes his photography will alert people to the risks that rising sea levels pose to coastal infrastructure and encourage people to take action to address climate change before it's too late.

> America's vanishing coastlines

A:" I had the idea to photograph the coasts of the world, but starting with the coasts of America, to look at what our infrastructure was in preparation for the ocean rise and storm effects that we know that climate change will bring."

> J Henry Fair is a photographer and environmental activist. His latest work captures the ever-changing South Carolina coastline.

A:" It's already essentially at sea level, and the east coast of the US is subsiding. And, of course, the ocean is rising."

> Fair works with pilot groups dedicated to conservation efforts.

A:" I find a pilot, hopefully with one of these groups. But if they don't have a pilot in the region I want to fly, then I have to hire one. Often from a flight school. And then I make a plan, and then just fly and look for things."

> He looks to marry the scientific and the visual in his photography.

A:" I'm looking for spectacular untouched beauty, for infrastructure which will be overwhelmed by ocean rise or heavy storm activity. And then whatever surprise, be it a natural feature, or anything else that comes in my field of view."

A:" I'm hoping that these pictures will alert people, to the frailty of our coastal infrastructure, and prompt us to protect them."

A:" But more than that, prompt us to take action about climate change."
