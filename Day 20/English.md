## What happens when you age?

23 AUGUST 2019|HEALTH

In the United States, longevity has increased since the year 1900, where life expectancy was 47.Today, people live on average until 92 and the fastest growing age group is 85 and older.

At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's AgeLab, researchers are exploring what it means to grow old and how to help design a world that is more inclusive for the ageing population.

Everything is so much heavier. It definitely is harder to see.

"Oh my gosh, it fells so good to like see normally again!"

> The lab rewriting the narrative of old age

Old age is actually quite new. The older population is the fastest growing population around the world. By 2047, there will be more people over the age of 60 than there will be children under the age of 15.

And we here at the MIT AgeLab are trying to think about how new technologies, products, experiences, and dreams can help us live longer and better.

> At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientists are exploring what if feels like to grow old.

So AGNES is our ageing suit. She stands for Age Gain Now Empathy System. She is an empathy tool to help simulate a little bit of what it might feel like for folks to experience some of the more common physical changes as they age.

>ã€€Weights simulate muscle loss.

I'm definitely dragging my feet more than normal. I'm like shuffling.

> Bungees simulate strained mobility and limited stride.

It's like burning in my shoulders a little. Like, my muscles, you know?

Shoes simulate loss of balance.

> Gloves simulate reduced tactile sensation. Goggles simulate impaired accuity.

Everything was more difficult. It makes every like mundane task twice as hard. I think now I understand a little bit that it's  like a full body experience.

> This lab believes that the first step to improve our life is to understand what it feels like to be older.

So an older adult quite often will not tell us, shall we say, the full truth, either because they say 'Well, it's part of old age' or they don't know the science well enough to know this could easily be fixed.

> AgaLab created the Miss Daisy driving simulator in collaboration with car makers to make driving safer for older adults.
>
>This car measures biometric data and cognitive distractions and intervenes if it senses a decline in driver performance.
>
> Researchers hope this technology can soon be integrated into cars.

What I've seen in the lab, especially working with the Lifestyle Leaders group, who is a group of adults who are all 85 and older actually up to age 100.

These folks are so vibrant, they love life, they want to give back to the community, they love working with younger generations and they want to feel a sense of purpose and a sense of meaning.
