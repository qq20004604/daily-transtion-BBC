## Why you're more heroic than you think

> A study published in the American Psychologist suggests that there are more Good Samaritans out there than we might think.

> After studying hundreds of incidents captured on CCTV around the world, the researchers concluded that the so-called 'bystander effect' may not tell the whole story. People are actually more likely to help a stranger in distress.

That idea of us being individuals that are only interested in our own interest? That is not how it works.

The myth is that when people observe somebody in need of help in public then they have a tendency to just stand there and look at each other.

Our research shows that that's not at all what's happening.

> Marie's team analysed hundreds of CCTV clips.

From pretty low-scale conflicts to stabbing and really severe violence. 

> They found that 90% of the time three to four people intervened.

In all types of situations, they tried to deescalate the conflict they put themselves between the conflict parties trying to pull them apart.

So is it always a good idea to play an active role? Is it also a good idea to be active if you're in an armed robbery situation?

> Many police forces advise people to call them and not intervene.

We were surprised by the high frequency of [interventions] and we were also surprised by seeing similar frequencies in these three different countries that we looked at.(Netherlands, South Africa, United Kingdom)

As a cultural anthropologist I would have expected pretty big cultural differences. But what we see is that there are some universal features in these very tense situations.

> So the 'bystander effect': Disproved?

A lot of social psychologists would be pretty upset if I were to say I disproved it. In many ways I think we did. But the point is that they've been looking at something else than what we've been looking at.

So our point now is that now with the CCTV footage we can actually gain an understanding of human behaviour in a way that we haven't been able to get before.

Violence and aggression, you can't study that in a lab setting. The urgency is different in real life. So that idea that if you stumble when you enter the subway and people will not help you I mean that's not what we see. That's an idea we all have but that's not how reality works.
