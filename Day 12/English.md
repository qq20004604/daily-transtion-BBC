## The tiny nation waging war on plastic

Plastic has become like a monster!

It does not only affect the animals on the land, but also marine life. Especially turtles, fish. 

> The tiny nation waging war on plastic

Vanuatu is an island nation in the South Pacific. It has one of the world's toughest plastic bans. To protect its reefs, forests and rivers, Vanuatu banned single-use plastic bags, straws and polystyrene boxes in 2018.

Before there was so much plastic. After the ban, you don't see any single-use plastic shopping bags. And it's so good, I love it.

> Market chef Myriam Melo was one of many campaigning for change.

The first time when we said to ban the plastic bags, people were angry. In the market I had to tell all the mamas. It wasn't a job that was easy, it was difficult.

They usually take plastic to go if they got it. They usually take plastic when they come out of the shop, they give plastic free.

We had to make many meetings to do that with all the presidents. We signed the petition, and then the government said that it is very important.

> Alternatives including traditional bags have received a boost.

The plastic ban - it helped us a lot, especially with the economic empowerment. It has increased and the demand is very high. The women at home, around the towns, are doing their living. It's becoming their business. Their real business at this time.

In our data from the clean-ups that we've done, we've definitely seen plastic bags go from the number one item that we pick up and dropping down.

But there is yet many work behind. When you clean up somewhere like a river or in saltwater, you will see that there is still plastic.

> With no recycling plant, most plastic ends up in landfill.

The thing that has made it easier for Vanuatu to ban, is because all the plastics we have are being imported. So we either need to have good collection systems in places, or we ban the plastics.

I would prefer that the government will see again if it can ban the plastic bottles, all t he things made from plastic - if it could ban it, that would be great!

> In December, seven more items will be outlawed

Polystyrene trays for food packaging, mesh for food and vegetable packaging, plastic cups and polystyrene cups, plastic cutlery: knives, spoons and forks, plastic stirrers.

There are obviously other things you can't ban. Being a net importer of food, where we we don't manufacture lots of things ourselves here, it's very difficult for us as a country to ban plastic food wrappers.

We'll have to rely on big manufacturers from elsewhere that are exporting to places like Vanuatu to come up with a different solution.

My aim is that one day, we just have to use all the local products that we have. It's the traditional way, the local way. I will be happy. But happy mostly for my country, happy mostly that my environment will be clean, and happy for nature.
