## How medieval monks are revealing our universe's mysteries

Marilina Cesario, medievalist:

People have got so many misconceptions about the Middle Ages, starting with the idea of being called Dark Ages, where we don't even know where that comes from.

And also this idea that, in terms of astronomy, the medieval people thought that the Earth was flat - they never did.

We have no evidence of that. 

>ã€€Astronomer Pedro Lacerda and medievalist Marilina Cesario are working on a project that challenges our assumptions about early medieval science.

Pedro Lacerda, astronomer:

Comets are these strange objects which are very unpredictable in the way they behave, they can explode, they can split - all sorts of strange things can happen.

So we need observations, we need a record of that - of what was seen, when.

And usually I only work with observations that are done in the last maybe 50 years, and this project uses observations of people that lived a thousand years age, it's almost like I can pick up the phone and call one of these monks a thousand years ago and ask them, "Hey, my computer tells me there should have been a comet in the sky on this date, did you see it?"

> Anglo Saxon England was a highly religious society - but there is clear evidence people were also very interested in science.

Marilina Cesario:

The Anglo-Saxons really tried to understand the cosmos. If the Anglo-Saxons saw a comet as an omen or a portent - which also was the case, for telling and predicting the death of an important king or war, famine, this doesn't mean that we're not interested in understanding how that comet worked.

> There were no universities in the early medieval period in England, so much of the learning and teaching was done in monasteries.

Venerable Bede was one of the most influential and important intellectual scholars from the Middle Ages.

He was a monk from Northumbria and he lived between the end of the 7th, beginning of the 8th Centuries.


> In 729AD he wrote a book about the stars and the planets- but it took about 13 centuries for the text to be translated from Latin into English.

And I guess some of the myths that we have about the Middle Ages as well comes from this difficulty of accessing the language, which can be either Latin or Old English or any other mdieval vernacular language and accessing his material isn't easy.

> Marilina and Pedro are particularly fascinated by sightings of comets in the medieval period that can be linked to currently known comets,

Pedro Lacerda:

So we try to work with comets that have periods of orbits around the sun, that means that they came back maybe ten times since the middle ages.

But there are comets the come from much larger distances, from a region called the Oort Cloud and those come back once every million years, so if one of those comets was seen by the monks, I will not be able to reproduce that observation.

But it will be important to know that things were seen in the sky because it gives us an idea of how many of these comets were visiting the Earth as a function of time.

Marilina Cesario:

Medieval monks described comets in quite a bit of detail and sometimes they give the month, the date, sometimes even the hour on which the comet was seen and occurred.

So we get lots of information that is useful.

> In 729AD the Venerable Bede saw two comets in the sky, and recorded the sighting in his book Ecclesiastical History,

>"... two comets appeared around the sun," he wrote, "striking terror into all who saw them".

Pedro Lacerda:

What I was very surprised about is how much there is still to look for in these texts. I thought, "Well, this stuff has been written a thousand years ago, we probably know everything there is to know about it" but it's not true. Since I started working on this project, I've been learning that we're still discovering manuscripts, they're still being translated - so there is still material that is not known.So there's a lot of things to discover.
