Algae bio-curtains:

Here in east London, a team of architects and scientists are busy developing technology, they think could change the look of cities everywhere and help save the planet.

It involves these: Bio-curtains. They can be fitted to the outside of any building. They are filled with algae taken from their natural home, they are treated in a lab.

Gel is added to optimise their performance.

Why do this? Well algae are very naturally efficient at turning carbon dioxide into oxygen.

When the sun shines on the curtains, photosynthesis take place.

Polluted city air is drawn in from the bottom of the curtain.

The single-cell algae absorb the carbon and oxygen is released at the top.

The inventors say it is an effective way to cut down greenhouse gas emissions in cities.

Dr Marco Poletto says:" This is effectively an extremely efficient way to introduce photosynthesis within the built environment."

In terms of air-cleaning power he reckons one of these curtains is equivalent to a mature tree.

So far the bio-curtains have been installed at the Customs and Revenue House in Dublin and most recently House of Nobility palace in Helsinki.

However the scientists behind the idea acknowledge the curtains would have to be adopted on a very large scale to start making any meaningful impact.

Dr Marco Poletto:"It's law, so UK is aiming to become carbon neutral by 2050. London has got it in its plan. We have to, at the same time, reduce the amount of carbon we emit but also actively absorb."

There are some drawbacks to these bio-curtains compared to trees.

At the moment the curtain material is only 70% biodegradable - the rest plastic. 

Also, as the algae grow, they have to be harvested on a regular basis which requires maintenance.

This is one reason the curtains work out more expensive than trees though they take up less space.

But for the scientists involved, this project is also about changing our relationship to nature.

Claudia Pasquero:" CO2 is not negative per se, we cannot breathe it as human beings but it is a nutrient for micro algae. So we can make an alliance with micro algae to be able to interact with the air of the city with the metabolism of the city and change it in a positive manner."
